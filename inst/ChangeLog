optpart 3.0-2

This is fairly major upgrade to optpart.  

1) The Fortran code was converted to f90, Several new routines were
added

2) several new routines were added

   2.1) optimclass - find best partition solution by indicator species
   2.2) gensilwidth - generalized mean silhouette width routine
   2.3) gamma - Goodman's gamma clustering validity
   2.4) flexbeta - flexible beta clustering

optpart 2.3-0

changes a number of REAL*4 constants to REAL*8 (and other
simple changes) to avoid warnings from gfortan -pedantic


optpart 2.1-1

fixed a (benign) out of bounds error in maxpact

optpart 2.1-0

1) updated optpart to NAMESPACE format

2) added several new utility functions to manage clusters

   2.1) bestfit - Find the Representative Elements of a Cluster
   2.2) compare - Compare the Constancy of Specific Types
   2.3) consider - Suggestions for Possibly Merging Clusters
   2.4) mergeclust - Merge Clusters
   2.5) reordclust - Reorder Cluster Numbers
   2.6) typal - Find the Typal Members of Each Cluster

   3) cleaned up the documentation for several functions

optpart 1.2-1

changed testpart to have class 'testpart' and improved the print function.
It now reports class fractions of misfits as well as individual misfit
plots, and allows setting a threshold misfit value for inclusion in the 
output (default=0.0)


optpart 1.1-0

There are several interesting changes to 1.1-0.

1) there are now four different iterative re-assignment classification
algorithms:

   1.1) optpart - to optimize the partana statistic
   1.2) optsil - to optimize silhouette widths
   1.3) optindval - to optimize Dufrene and Legendre indicator values
   1.4) opttdev - to optimize table deviance

2) the iterative re-assigmnent algorithms now all have multiple inheritance.
   2.1) their own specific class, and 
   2.2) clustering - which is shared with several other simpler algorithms
